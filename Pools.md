# 🏦 Gamba Liquidity Pools Deep Dive

Gamba's liquidity pools are the cornerstone of the betting ecosystem, acting as the house that players bet against. These pools are not just integral to the mechanics of Gamba; they embody the spirit of decentralization and profit-sharing.

## 🚀 Creating a Pool

Creating a liquidity pool on Gamba is as straightforward as it is rewarding. With support for any custom Solana token, pools offer a versatile foundation for the platform's diverse gaming offerings.

- **Explorer UI**: Dive right in and create or join an existing pool via the [Gamba Explorer](https://explorer.gamba.so/create). This intuitive interface ensures that anyone, regardless of technical prowess, can participate.
- **Gamba SDK**: For those looking to interact with pools programmatically or create more complex integrations, the Gamba SDK provides all the necessary tools. [Delve deeper into the SDK](https://docs.gamba.so/sdk) to unlock the full potential of Gamba's liquidity pools.

## 💰 LP Token Mechanics

Upon pool creation, a corresponding LP (Liquidity Provider) token is minted. This token is pivotal, representing your share in the pool's liquidity and potential earnings.

- **Initial Deposit Ratio**: Start with a 1:1 ratio of LP tokens to the underlying token. This equitable starting point ensures fairness for early contributors.
- **Dynamic Ratios**: As the pool's liquidity fluctuates with game outcomes, so does the ratio of LP tokens. Winners and losers affect the pool, but ultimately, liquidity providers stand to gain, especially when the LP token's value increases due to the pool's success.

## 🎁 Bonuses Galore

In a move to enhance player engagement, each pool features Bonus tokens, serving as incentives for participation or as free play options.

- **Minting and Usage**: Exchange the pool's underlying token for Bonus tokens, which are earmarked for betting. It's a one-way transaction — these tokens are burned after use, emphasizing their role as a dynamic engagement tool rather than a static currency.
- **Allocation**: 90% of the underlying tokens used for minting Bonus tokens feed into a dedicated fund, ripe for the winning. The remaining 10% bolster the jackpot pool, creating a tantalizing target for players.

## 🎰 Jackpot Dynamics

The jackpot represents the pinnacle of excitement within Gamba's ecosystem, growing with each failed attempt until a lucky player strikes it big.

- **Contribution**: A minor portion of the jackpot winnings is funneled back into the liquidity pool, ensuring its continued growth and sustainability.
- **Flexibility**: Platform developers have the autonomy to integrate the jackpot feature as they see fit, tailoring the experience to their audience's preferences.

# Apps

## Introduction

Gamba Apps/Platforms represent the interactive frontends that integrate seamlessly with the Gamba on-chain program. These platforms allow users to engage in a variety of betting games, leveraging the robustness of blockchain technology to ensure fairness and transparency.

### The Core of Gamba Apps

At their core, Gamba Apps are designed to facilitate an engaging betting experience, connecting users directly to the decentralized gaming environment of Gamba. Owners of these apps can harness the liquidity of Gamba across multiple tokens, thereby generating revenue through transaction fees without incurring any personal financial risk.

## Revenue Generation Model

### Creator Address

The cornerstone of revenue generation for app owners is the "creator address"â€”a unique Solana address associated with each app. This address captures a portion of the transaction fees from play activities on the app, tapping into Gamba's diverse liquidity pools.

#### Advantages:

- **Access to Gamba's Liquidity**: Leverage the extensive liquidity across various tokens within the Gamba ecosystem.
- **Fee-Based Revenue**: Earn from the transaction fees generated by the betting games on your platform.
- **Zero Initial Investment**: Generate revenue without the need for personal capital investment.

## Simplified Platform Setup

The creation of a Gamba App is intentionally streamlined, requiring only a simple webpage to host the app. This approach eliminates the complexity of backend deployments, making it easier for individuals to launch their own betting games or casinos.
